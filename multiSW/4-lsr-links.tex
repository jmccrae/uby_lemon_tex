\section{Linking \emph{lemonUby} to lexical-semantic resources}

As UBY is derived from existing resources the simplest links to create are those
to other RDF versions of the resources that compose UBY. For WordNet these links 
are simply created by mapping the data of UBY to the linked data version of 
WordNet 3.0~\footnote{\url{http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/}}. Here,
we provided links at both the sense level and at the lexical entry level 
(lexical entries are ``words'' in WordNet 3.0). We found that this worked apart
from 7 senses that did not map, which we believe is due to a bug in the 
WordNet API. 

In addition, we provided links to two existing resources that are also widely
used, firstly to RDF WordNet 2.0~\cite{van2006conversion}. As the sense identifiers are
different to the WordNet version used by UBY we only attempted to link at the lexical 
entry level, using the assumption that the lemmas were the same. Secondly, we 
linked to the RDF export of Wiktionary~\footnote{\url{http://wiktionary.dbpedia.org}}.
For this resource, we first linked the WordNet data on the lexical entry level using 
the lemma and part-of-speech information. This was mostly effective, however some
elements were initially missing due to category misalignment (Wiktionary has
``Initialism'' as a part-of-speech, for example for ``IBM'', whereas WordNet
counts these as nouns); we added manual corrections to compensate 
for this. Statistics for all mappings are given in table \ref{mapping-stats}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{3cm}|}
    \hline
    Uby Resource & Other Resource & Links (Percentage of Uby resource) \\
    \hline
    WordNet & WordNet 3.0 & 206,773 (99.9\%)\\
    WordNet & WordNet 2.0 & 84,416 (40.8\%) \\
    WordNet & Wiktionary & 76,294 (36.9\%) \\
    \hline
