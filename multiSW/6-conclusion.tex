\section{Conclusion}

This chapter describes methods for multilingual data integration on the Semantic Web which  rely 
crucially on semantically interoperable language resources, i.e., language resources which are linked to reference
terminology repositories, such as OLiA or ISOCat.
The use cases of \emph{lemonUby} described in this chapter give a good indication of the
potential benefits of linking language resources on the Web on a large scale.
