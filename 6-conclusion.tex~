\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a new linked data resource called \emph{lemonUby}, which
combines the data from the UBY lexicon with the principled model, \emph{lemon},
for representing lexical data on the web. This resource provides not only a
rich information about many lexical entries in two languages, it is also
significantly linked both within its component resources and also to other
lexical resources and meta-data repositories on the web.
