\section{Introduction}

Recently, the language resource (LR) community has begun to explore the opportunities offered by the Semantic
Web, lead by the formation of the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud
and an increasing interest in making use of Linked Open Data principles in the context
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Linguistics  \cite{chiarcos2012linked}. 
The use of RDF supports data integration and offers a large body of tools for accessing this data,
and furthermore, the linked data approach gives rise to novel research questions in the context of
language resources and their application.

 For lexical resources, data integration has been in
 the focus of interest for many years, resulting in numerous mappings and linkings of lexicons, as well as 
standards for representing lexical resources, such as the ISO 24613:2008 Lexical Markup Framework
(LMF) \cite{francopoulo2006lexical}. In this context, the LLOD cloud can be considered as a new data integration platform, enabling linkings not only between lexical resources, but also between lexical resources and
other language resources.

Many lexical resources have already been included in the LLOD cloud, e.g., WordNet, Wikipedia 
(DBpedia \cite{Bizer_Lehmann_Kobilarov_Auer_Becker_Cyganiak_Hellmann_2009}),
and Wiktionary, as well as integrated resources, such as an integrated version of WordNet and Wiktionary\cite{mccrae2012integrating}, or of  WordNet and Wikipedia (BabelNet, \cite{navigli2012babelnet}).
There has also been some work towards the integration of FrameNet \cite{baker1998berkley} to the Semantic Web \cite{narayanan2003framenet}.
All these resources provide a substantial body of lexical knowledge, including semantic relations, multilingual
information and encyclopedic knowledge.

However, what is missing in the LLOD cloud is a large-scale lexical resource rich in lexical information on
verbs, including aspects such as syntactic behavior and how semantic arguments of verbs can be realized
syntactically. Such information is crucial for lexicalizing relational knowledge which is often expressed
by using verbs, e.g., the relation $like(Experiencer, Theme)$ can be lexicalized syntactically as "NP likes NP".
%Such information is crucial for lexicalizing relational knowledge which is typically expressed
%by using verbs along with specific arguments.

\emph{lemon}, a lexicon model for representing and sharing ontology lexica, 
has been proposed as a common interchange format for lexical resources on the Semantic Web\cite{mccrae2012interchanging}. 
Making use of a common interchange format
is important, to integrate resources such as FrameNet and WordNet, which have been characterized as
complementary resources~\cite{baker2009wordnet}. The RDF version of FrameNet currently available does not adhere to an interchange format such as \emph{lemon}, but is specific to the underlying data model of FrameNet.

%In the current LLOD cloud, large-scale lexical resources rich in encyclopedic knowledge, such as DBPedia, are 
%predominant, while
%the size and diversity of lexical resources rich in linguistic knowledge, particularly for verbs,
% is limited so far.
% There has already been some work towards the integration of FrameNet \cite{baker1998berkley} to the Semantic Web \cite{narayanan2003framenet},
%as well as WordNet 
%\cite{van2006conversion}, WordNet and Wiktionary\cite{mccrae2012integrating}, and recently BabelNet as a multilingual
%lexical resource integrating WordNet and Wikipedia \cite{navigli2012babelnet}.
% In the Semantic Web, several versions of WordNet REF
%and FrameNet REF have been available as linked data for quite same time, but due to the LLOD movement
%new resources such as
%Wiktionary REF and BabelNet REF have been added just recently.
%However, the LLOD cloud contains no large-scale lexical resource yet, which is rich in lexical information on
%verbs, including aspects such as their syntactic behavior and how semantic arguments of verbs can be realized
%syntactically. Such information is crucial for lexicalizing relational knowledge which is typically expressed
%by using verbs along with specific arguments.

Independently from linked data principles and Semantic Web technology, the large-scale lexical-semantic resource UBY \cite{gurevych2012uby} has been developed\footnote{\url{http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/uby/}}.
UBY is based on LMF and has currently integrated 10 LRs in English and German. A subset of these resources
is interlinked at the word sense level. 
The dataset presented in this paper, \emph{lemonUby}, is the result of converting a selection of UBY lexicons to
the \emph{lemon} format:
it contains interoperable and interlinked versions of WordNet, FrameNet,
VerbNet \cite{kipper2008large}, multilingual
OmegaWiki\footnote{\url{http://www.omegawiki.org}} and
Wiktionary~\footnote{\url{http://www.wiktionary.org}}. 
 To summarize, our contributions are threefold: (i) an interlinked lexical resource rich
in linguistic information on verbs also containing a lot of multilingual information, 
(ii) a mapping of the lexicon model UBY-LMF to \emph{lemon}, and (iii)
the linking of \emph{lemonUby} to other language resources in the LLOD cloud.

%Moreover, the
%format chosen for the RDF versions of FrameNet and WordNet 
% was specific to the underlying data model of these two resources which have been characterized as
%complementary by \cite{Baker:2009}. 
%However, the LLOD cloud contains no large-scale lexical resource yet which is rich in lexical information on
%verbs, including aspects such as their syntactic behavior and how semantic arguments of verbs can be realized
%syntactically. Such information is crucial for lexicalizing relational knowledge which is typically expressed
%by using verbs along with specific arguments.
%The dataset \emph{lemonUby} which we present in this paper addresses these gaps: 
%it contains interoperable and interlinked versions of WordNet [FEL 98], FrameNet [BAK 98],
%VerbNet [KIP 08], and multilingual OmegaWiki (www.omegawiki.org). 
%\emph{lemonUby} is linked to the LLOD cloud and has a number of 
%additional features that add significant value to the LLOD cloud. We will describe these features and the creation
%of this dataset in the following sections.
