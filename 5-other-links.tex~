LLOD terminology repositories:
The General Ontology of Linguistic Description (GOLD)\footnote{\url{http://linguistics-ontology.org/}} 
is an ontology for descriptive linguistics and focuses on formalizing definitions
for morphosyntactic categories \cite{farrar2003linguistic}. It is an attempt to 
codify general knowledge about the field of linguistics with the goal of facilitating 
automated reasoning over linguistic data and it provides a large number of URIs for 
linguistic resources to use for terminology resolution. GOLD does currently not contain
an explicit license statement, but it is available online, and as a community project,
publication under an open license can be expected. A similar problem persists 
with ISOcat that aims to assemble data categories relevant for linguistic resources, 
including annotation, metadata, etc. \cite{kemps2008isocat}. At the moment, the
content of ISOcat is available, but no explicit license is given. However, people
involved (Menzo Windhouwer, p.c., June 2012) believe that a publication under 
an open license would be appreciated, but it has not been clarified whether the
restrictive licensing policy of the ISO that applies to the ISOcat technical 
specifications also extends to the ISOcat data categories.

The Ontologies of Linguistic Annotation (OLiA) represent a repository of annotation 
terminology for various linguistic phenomena currently applied to about 70 languages 
\cite{chiarcos2008ontology,chiarcos2012ontologies}. The OLiA ontologies were 
developed as part of an infrastructure for the sustainable maintenance of 
linguistic resources \cite{schmidt2006avoiding}, and their primary fields of 
application include the formalization of annotation schemes and concept-based 
querying over heterogeneously annotated corpora \cite{rehm2008ontology}, although
recently, a broader application, especially in Natural Language Processing, 
has been suggested \cite{chiarcos2012ontologies}.

In a Linked Data context, the OLiA ontologies act as a central reference hub for
linguistic annotations, in that they provide formal definitions of annotation 
schemes as OWL/DL ontologies. Further, OLiA establishes interoperability between
different annotation schemes by linking them to an overarching `Reference Model'.
Through the OLiA Reference Model, interoperability with community-maintained data
category registries can be achieved, because it is linked to the General Ontology
of Linguistic Description \cite[GOLD]{farrar2003markup} and to an OWL/DL 
representation of the morphosyntactic profile of the ISO TC37/SC4 Data 
Category Registry \cite[ISOcat]{kemps2008isocat}.
