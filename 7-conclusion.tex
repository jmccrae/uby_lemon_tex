\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\noindent
We presented \emph{le\-mon\-U\-by}, a new linked data resource which
combines data from the standardized lexical resource UBY with the principled model, \emph{lemon},
for representing lexical data on the web. This resource provides not only
rich information about many lexical entries in two languages, it is also
 linked at the word sense level both within its component resources and to other
language resources on the web.

We see two main directions for future research on \emph{le\-mon\-U\-by}: first, the 
further linking of this dataset both within \emph{le\-mon\-U\-by} and to other
resources on the web, and second, the use of \emph{le\-mon\-U\-by}
in RDF-based NLP applications in order to gain a deeper understanding of the added value of linked lexical resources
for NLP.
